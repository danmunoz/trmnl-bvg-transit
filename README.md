### How to Find Your Stop ID

To use this plugin, youâ€™ll need the Stop ID of the location you want to monitor.

You can retrieve this by making a GET request to the [BVG locations endpoint](https://v6.bvg.transport.rest/api.html#get-locations). Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl 'https://v6.bvg.transport.rest/locations?query=alexanderplatz&results=1&linesOfStops=true' -s | jq
```

Replace `alexanderplatz` with the name of the stop you're interested in.
